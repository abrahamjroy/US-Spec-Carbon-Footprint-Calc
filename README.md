# India-Spec-Carbon-Footprint-Calculator
Creating a Carbon footprint calculator to satisfy my green thumbs



This webpage demonstrated the use of a JS and CSS to create a Carbon Footprint calculator, that displays your carbon footprint that can be customized according to your location, that is used to access the local CO2 database, and display your current location (Big brother style :-D )



The images used are obtained from generic sites and can be customized to your liking



the units have been adjusted to suit India's Metric units, and most of the code has been modified to suit the local geography
